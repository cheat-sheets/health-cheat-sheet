## Mediators

### GABA and Glutamate: Yin and Yang of the Brain

**[GABA (gamma-Aminobutyric acid)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gamma-Aminobutyric_acid)** 
is the chief **inhibitory** neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.
Low GABA levels are associated with restlessness, anxiety, insomnia and a poor mood state.

**[Glutamate](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glutamate_(neurotransmitter))** 
is the chief **excitatory** neurotransmitter in the central nervous system.

### Serotonin

**Serotonin** or 5-hydroxytryptamine (5-HT) is both a mediator and a hormone. First it was discovered in vessel walls,
where it causes constriction (thus the name). 

Serotonin functions:

- Inhibitory/calming function. Induces sleep.
- Reduces pain sensitivity. 
- Inhibits weak neural signals in the brain (helps GABA). Helps to focus on the main task.
- Inhibits negative emotions.

[Increasing Serotonin without drugs](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2077351/) (there is no direct proof
the methods described below work):

- Positive mood inductions.
- Exposure to bright light. [Lux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lux). Intensity of light inside a room (320 - 500 lux)
is 20 times lower than the intensity of light outside at full daylight (10,000 - 25,000 lux).
- Exercise.
- Diet - foods with high tryptophan content may increase serotonin in the brain (chickpeas, hummus).

## Nutrition

### The 5 basic tastes

The 5 basic tastes help us identify nutrients in the food that are important for our body:

- **Sweet** - sugar, source of energy.
- **Salty** - salt, important for maintaining ion balance - potassium/sodium.
- **Sour** - acid, important for maintaining pH balance.
- **Bitter** - many bitter compounds are bitter and toxic. 
    Some antioxidants are bitter and healthy e.g. chocolate, coffee.
- **Umami** - glutamate, contained in protein food, source of building material for cells in our body.


## Immune System

There are 2 types of immune system:

- Innate - works within minutes/hours.
    - Lysozyme (muramidase) - antimicrobial enzyme. Destroys membrane of bacteria. Contained in saliva, tears, human 
    milk, mucus, egg whites. 
    - Interferon (IFNs) - produced by cells in response to viruses.
    - The complement system - consists of a number of small proteins that are synthesized by the liver, and circulate in
    the blood as inactive precursors. When stimulated by one of several triggers, proteases in the system cleave 
    specific proteins to release cytokines and initiate an amplifying cascade of further cleavages.   
    - Granulocyte - a category of white blood cells (WBCs, aka leukocytes) characterized by the presence of granules in 
    their cytoplasm.
    - Macrophage - a category of white blood cells, that engulfs and digests cellular debris, foreign substances, 
    microbes, cancer cells, and anything else that does not have the type of proteins specific to healthy body cells 
    on its surface in a process called phagocytosis.
    - Natural killer cell - are a type of cytotoxic lymphocyte, provide rapid responses to virus-infected cells, 
    acting at around 3 days after infection, and respond to tumor formation. 
- **Adaptive** - works within days/weeks.
    - **Antibodies** (aka immunoglobulin (**Ig**)) - Y-shaped protein produced mainly by plasma cells that is used by the 
    immune system to neutralize pathogens such as pathogenic bacteria and viruses. Tags that are attached to antigens.
        - ~100MLN of types of antibody binding sites (paratopes). Determined by random combination of fragments in 
        5 positions (3 for long chain, 2 for short chain) in each binding site. Much smaller amount of genes are needed
        to encode the fragments, which are then randomly combined when immune cells are generated.
        - 5 types of antibody handles: IgA, gD, IgE, IgG, IgM
    - **B lymphocyte** (B-cells) - secrete antibodies.
    - **T lymphocyte** (T-cells) - there are a few subtypes: 
        - T-helpers type 1 - activate macrophages.
        - T-helpers type 2 - interact with B-cells.
        - T-killers - kills cells infected with viruses.
    
Adaptive immune system detects antigens using antibodies, produces more antibodies, which are attached to antigens as
tags, then those tags are detected by innate immune system cells phagocytes and destroyed.  

After the first infection it may take 14 days for the adaptive immune system to produce the sufficient amount of 
antibodies. After that the immune system learns, the body already has a lot of B lymphocytes for the seen antigen.
For subsequent infection the immune system will take 1 - 2 days to produce the sufficient amount of antibodies.

All blood cells are differentiated from stem cells produced in bone marrow.

**Blood cell types**:

- **Red blood cells** (erythrocytes) - the cells that deliver oxygen to the body tissues.
- **White blood cells** (leukocytes) - the cells of the immune system.
    - Lymphocytes - white blood cells of adaptive immune system.
    - Phagocytes - white blood cells of innate immune system.
- **Platelets** (thrombocytes) - the cells that react to bleeding from blood vessel injury by clumping, 
thereby initiating a blood clot.

## The Science of Well Being

Biases of our brain that affect how happy we are:

- We don't think in terms of absolutes, we constantly compare ourselves to reference points, we don't have control
over what those reference points are. In other words we compare ourselves to people around us or 
who we see on TV/Facebook.
- Our minds are built to get used to stuff. We become less happy from things that made us more happy before.
- We don't realize that our minds are built to get used to stuff.
 
Strategies to counteract our bias of getting used to stuff:
 
- **Savoring** - the act of stepping outside of an experience to review and appreciate it (sharing good experiences
with others, showing physical expressions of energy, telling yourself how proud you are)  
- **Negative visualization** - thinking about the reverse that could have happened (couples wrote for 15 minutes about
how they might never had met their partner) 
- **Make this day your last** - thinking about having something for the last day, e.g. spending your last day at 
University.  
- **Gratitude** - the quality of being thankful and a tendency to show appreciation for what one has.

Strategies to counteract our bias of comparing ourselves to reference points:

- **Concretely re-experience** - go back and re-experience what your old reference point was before, e.g. remember your 
first day at your job that you like more than the previous job.
- **Concretely observe** - compare yourself to worse reference points.
- **Avoid social comparisons** - delete Facebook, Twitter, Youtube apps from your phone.
- **Interrupt your consumption** - e.g. if you're listening to music, make an interruption for some time and then return 
to it.
- **Increase your variety** - e.g. eat different kinds of ice-cream instead of same one. 

Right things to want:

- Don't look for a job with high pay, instead look for a job where you can utilize your signature strengths, achieve
flow.
- Kindness increases happiness. One study shows that spending money on someone else rather than yourself increases
happiness.  
- Social connections make us happier. One study shows that talking to strangers on a metro train makes both
 parties happier.
- Time affluence - people who prioritize time over money are happier.
- Mind wandering (when you default network is active) makes people unhappy. **Meditation** is the practice of
turning your attention away from distracting thoughts toward a single point of reference (e.g. the breath, 
bodily sensations, compassion, a specific thought, etc.)
- Exercise, sleep makes you happier.
